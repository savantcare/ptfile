## How to write a component

3 core concepts:

1. The entrance file is: [search-interfaces.vue](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/blob/master/ptclient/cts/spi/rem/search-interfaces.vue)
   This component gives the search terms for the search dropdown by getting [imported](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/blob/85e1510dd834a7e812e2a2ec37eaf26d2c2aa91f/ptclient/cts/core/vl-search-box/index.vue#L24) then [defined](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/blob/85e1510dd834a7e812e2a2ec37eaf26d2c2aa91f/ptclient/cts/core/vl-search-box/index.vue#L31) and then [mounted](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/blob/85e1510dd834a7e812e2a2ec37eaf26d2c2aa91f/ptclient/cts/core/vl-search-box/index.vue#L4) inside
   [vl-search-box/index.vue](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/blob/master/ptclient/cts/core/vl-search-box/index.vue) For the flow chart see [vl-search-box](./core/vl-search-box/README.md)

2. Each component will usually have sub components for [vl](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/tree/master/ptclient/cts/spi/rem/vl) and [cl](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/tree/master/ptclient/cts/spi/rem/cl). Terms like [vl](../../GLOSSARY.html#others) and [cl](../../GLOSSARY.html#others) are explained in [glossary](../../GLOSSARY). Which subcomponent is invoked is based on [search term](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/blob/85e1510dd834a7e812e2a2ec37eaf26d2c2aa91f/ptclient/cts/spi/rem/search-interfaces.vue#L15) the keys [ctToShowInCSVL](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/blob/85e1510dd834a7e812e2a2ec37eaf26d2c2aa91f/ptclient/cts/spi/rem/search-interfaces.vue#L17) and [ctToShowInCL](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/blob/85e1510dd834a7e812e2a2ec37eaf26d2c2aa91f/ptclient/cts/spi/rem/search-interfaces.vue#L26) inside [search-interfaces.vue](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/blob/master/ptclient/cts/spi/rem/search-interfaces.vue)

3. Data in a component is [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) through a [model](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/blob/master/ptclient/cts/spi/rem/db/vuex-orm/rem.js). During CRUD the status of row is maintained inside [rowstatus.js](https://github.com/savantcare/ptfile/blob/master/ptclient/cts/core/crud/rowstatus.js)
